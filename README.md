# Number Dictionary

This is a program that takes a number as an input argument and converts it to its written value. The program can take up to 2 arguments:
- If there is only one argument, it is the value you need to convert.
- If there are two arguments, the first is the new reference dictionary and the second argument is the value it needs to convert.
If the argument is not an unsigned integer, the program returns 'Error'.

The dictionary shall follow the following rules
`[a number][0 to n spaces]:[0 to n spaces][any printable character]`
